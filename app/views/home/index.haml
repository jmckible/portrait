  %p Portrait is a web service for capturing a webpage as an image. This particular instance is password protected, but you can download your own copy. Portrait works across different platforms, including OS X, Linux and Windows. It does however require the presence of the headless JS browser PhantomJS. If you'd like to use portrait within a ruby project, check out portrait_party.
